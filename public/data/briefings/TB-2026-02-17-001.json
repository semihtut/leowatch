  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "A critical zero-day vulnerability was discovered in Apple's dyld component, which is the Dynamic Link Editor responsible for loading software libraries on every Apple device. The flaw allows attackers to corrupt memory and execute malicious code. Apple confirmed this was used in extremely sophisticated real-world attacks against specific targeted individuals. Google's Threat Analysis Group found and reported the bug. This is the first actively exploited Apple zero-day of 2026.",
    "who_is_affected": "Every Apple device user is potentially affected: iPhones and iPads running iOS/iPadOS before 26.3, Mac computers running macOS Tahoe before 26.3, Sequoia before 15.7.4, or Sonoma before 14.8.4, Apple TVs running tvOS before 26.3, Apple Watches running watchOS before 26.3, and Apple Vision Pro running visionOS before 26.3. Organizations with BYOD policies or Apple device fleets are especially at risk.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Attackers identify high-value targets such as journalists, activists, government officials, or corporate executives. Step 2: They deliver a malicious payload that exploits WebKit vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-14174 or CVE-2025-43529) to gain initial memory access in the browser or web content process. Step 3: Using the memory write capability, attackers exploit CVE-2026-20700 in dyld to corrupt the dynamic linker's state management. Step 4: The corrupted dyld state allows arbitrary code execution outside the normal application sandbox, gaining deep system access. Step 5: With system-level code execution, attackers install persistent surveillance tools, exfiltrate sensitive data, or maintain long-term access to the compromised device.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Immediately update all Apple devices to iOS/iPadOS 26.3, macOS Tahoe 26.3, tvOS 26.3, watchOS 26.3, and visionOS 26.3",
      "For older devices, update to iOS 18.7.5, iPadOS 18.7.5, macOS Sequoia 15.7.4, or macOS Sonoma 14.8.4",
      "Enable automatic updates on all Apple devices to receive future security patches promptly",
      "Review MDM policies to enforce OS version minimums across managed device fleets",
      "Monitor for unusual device behavior including unexpected battery drain, overheating, or unexplained data usage"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because dyld runs at the core of every Apple operating system, affecting all Apple platforms simultaneously. The exploitation was confirmed as extremely sophisticated and targeted, typically associated with nation-state or commercial spyware operators. Google TAG's involvement in discovery suggests this may be linked to surveillance campaigns. CISA's addition to the KEV catalog with a March 5, 2026 deadline underscores the urgency for federal agencies and all organizations."
