  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "Two critical zero-day vulnerabilities were discovered in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), the enterprise platform used to manage corporate mobile devices. Attackers found they could inject malicious commands through HTTP requests without needing any login credentials. The flaws were already being exploited before Ivanti even knew about them, with attackers installing backdoors and reverse shells on compromised servers. A public proof-of-concept exploit is now available, dramatically increasing the risk.",
    "who_is_affected": "Any organization running on-premises Ivanti EPMM (formerly MobileIron Core) for mobile device management. This includes enterprises, government agencies, healthcare organizations, and military networks that rely on EPMM to manage employee smartphones and tablets. Cloud-hosted Ivanti Neurons for MDM is NOT affected.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Attackers send specially crafted HTTP GET requests to EPMM endpoints for app distribution or Android file transfer. Step 2: Malicious Bash commands embedded in the requests bypass all authentication checks. Step 3: The commands execute with EPMM service privileges on the underlying server. Step 4: Attackers install webshells (often modifying error pages like 401.jsp) and deploy WAR/JAR files for persistent reverse shell connections. Step 5: With full server access, attackers harvest administrator credentials, user data, email addresses, phone numbers, IMEI numbers, GPS locations, and can pivot to internal networks via the EPMM API.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Apply Ivanti RPM hotfix scripts immediately - no downtime required",
      "If your EPMM was internet-exposed before patching, assume compromise and initiate incident response",
      "Search Apache access logs for exploitation attempts using Ivanti's detection regex pattern",
      "Check for unauthorized webshells especially in error pages like 401.jsp",
      "Look for unexpected WAR or JAR files and outbound network connections from EPMM",
      "Reset all local EPMM passwords, LDAP/KDC service accounts, and public certificates",
      "Review Sentry logs for signs of lateral movement",
      "If compromise is confirmed, restore from known-good backup or rebuild the EPMM appliance",
      "Plan upgrade to EPMM 12.8.0.0 when released in Q1 2026 for permanent fix"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "EPMM manages the entire mobile device fleet of an organization. Compromise gives attackers access to every managed device's data including GPS locations, phone numbers, installed apps, and IMEI numbers. Attackers can also modify device authentication policies via the EPMM API, potentially pushing malicious configurations to thousands of corporate devices simultaneously. This is the third time EPMM has been hit with zero-days in three years, and a public exploit is now available, meaning mass exploitation is imminent."
