  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "ESET security researchers discovered a groundbreaking Android malware called PromptSpy that represents a dangerous first: it uses Google's Gemini generative AI assistant at runtime to automate malicious tasks on infected phones. The malware disguises itself as a fake JPMorgan Chase banking app called MorganArg, targeting users in Argentina. Once installed, PromptSpy uses VNC (remote desktop) capabilities to take full control of the device, captures lockscreen PINs, records the screen, and most notably, leverages Google Gemini's AI to intelligently navigate the phone's user interface to maintain persistence and evade removal. This is the first documented case of malware using a commercial generative AI service as part of its core attack chain.",
    "who_is_affected": "Android users in Argentina who may have downloaded the fake MorganArg banking application are the primary targets. However, the technique of weaponizing generative AI at runtime represents a threat to all Android users globally, as the approach can be adapted to target any region or banking institution. Organizations that allow employees to use personal Android devices for work (BYOD) face additional risk of corporate credential theft. Google Gemini users are indirectly affected as the AI service is being abused without their knowledge.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: The attackers distribute a fake JPMorgan Chase banking app called MorganArg through the malicious domain mgardownload[.]com, tricking Argentine users into sideloading the APK outside of Google Play Store. Step 2: Once installed, the malware requests Accessibility Service permissions, which grants it the ability to observe and interact with all apps and UI elements on the device. Step 3: PromptSpy activates its VNC module to establish a remote desktop connection back to the attacker's command-and-control server at 54.67.2[.]84, giving the attacker real-time visual access to the victim's screen. Step 4: The malware captures the device lockscreen PIN by overlaying a fake unlock screen, and continuously records the user's screen activity including banking sessions and private messages. Step 5: In a novel technique, PromptSpy sends prompts to the Google Gemini AI assistant asking it to navigate the device's recent apps menu, settings, and notification panels to keep the malware running in the foreground and prevent the user or the operating system from killing the malicious process, achieving AI-powered persistence.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Never sideload Android APKs from unknown sources; only install apps from the official Google Play Store and verify the developer identity",
      "Check your installed apps for any application named MorganArg or claiming to be a JPMorgan Chase app not published by JPMorgan Chase & Co.",
      "Review Accessibility Service permissions on your Android device (Settings > Accessibility) and revoke access for any unfamiliar or suspicious applications",
      "Block the known malicious domains mgardownload[.]com and m-mgarg[.]com and C2 IP 54.67.2[.]84 on your network security devices",
      "Enable Google Play Protect and ensure it is actively scanning your device for harmful applications"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "PromptSpy represents a paradigm shift in mobile malware by demonstrating that attackers can weaponize commercial generative AI services to make their malware smarter and more resilient. Traditional malware uses hardcoded logic that defenders can predict and block, but by leveraging Gemini AI for dynamic UI navigation, PromptSpy can adapt its behavior in real-time based on the device's current state. This makes it significantly harder to detect and remove. The technique is highly replicable and will almost certainly be adopted by other threat actors, potentially spawning a new generation of AI-enhanced malware. Combined with its banking trojan capabilities including VNC remote access and PIN capture, PromptSpy poses an immediate financial threat to victims and a strategic threat to the entire mobile security ecosystem."
