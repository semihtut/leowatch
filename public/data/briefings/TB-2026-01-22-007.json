  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "A sophisticated threat actor is running a large-scale campaign to steal cloud access tokens from enterprises. They target identity providers and cloud credentials stored on developer workstations. Once they have tokens, they access AWS, Azure, and GCP resources across multiple organizations.",
    "who_is_affected": "Enterprise organizations using multiple cloud providers, especially those with federated identity (SSO) between on-premises and cloud environments. Companies using HashiCorp Vault, Okta, or similar identity solutions are primary targets.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Phishing campaign targets IT administrators and developers. Step 2: Malware harvests stored cloud credentials and tokens. Step 3: Attackers enumerate cloud resources across all linked providers. Step 4: They establish persistent access via new IAM users/roles. Step 5: Data exfiltration and ransomware deployment begins.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Enforce MFA on all cloud console and API access immediately",
      "Review and rotate all service account credentials",
      "Check for unauthorized IAM users, roles, and access keys",
      "Enable cloud provider threat detection services",
      "Search for indicators of compromise in identity provider logs",
      "Implement conditional access policies based on device and location"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "Identity is the new perimeter in cloud environments. With valid tokens, attackers can access anything those credentials can access - databases, storage, compute, and secrets. Multi-cloud environments multiply the attack surface, and a single compromised identity can lead to breaches across all your cloud providers."
