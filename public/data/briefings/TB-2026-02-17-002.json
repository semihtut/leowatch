  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "A critical zero-day vulnerability was discovered in Google Chrome's CSS rendering engine. The flaw is a use-after-free bug, where Chrome accidentally uses memory that has already been freed, allowing attackers to hijack the browser's execution. Google confirmed that attackers were already exploiting this vulnerability in real-world attacks before the patch was available. This is the first Chrome zero-day exploited in the wild in 2026, and it affects all Chromium-based browsers including Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi.",
    "who_is_affected": "Anyone using Google Chrome or any Chromium-based browser (Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi) on Windows, macOS, or Linux is potentially vulnerable. With Chrome holding approximately 65% of the global browser market share, this affects billions of users worldwide. Organizations that rely on web-based applications and have not yet updated their browsers are at particular risk.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Attackers create a specially crafted malicious webpage containing CSS code designed to trigger the use-after-free condition in Chrome's rendering engine. Step 2: The victim visits the malicious page through a phishing link, malicious advertisement, or compromised legitimate website (drive-by attack). Step 3: The crafted CSS causes Chrome to free a memory object but then attempt to reference it again, creating a dangling pointer. Step 4: Attackers reallocate the freed memory with malicious data, redirecting Chrome's execution flow to attacker-controlled code. Step 5: Arbitrary code executes inside Chrome's sandbox, enabling credential theft, session hijacking, malware delivery, or chaining with a sandbox escape for full system compromise.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Immediately update Google Chrome to version 145.0.7632.75 or later (Menu > Help > About Google Chrome)",
      "Update all Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi) to their latest versions",
      "Restart browsers after updating to ensure the patch takes effect",
      "Enforce browser version policies via group policy or MDM in enterprise environments",
      "Educate users about phishing risks and suspicious links until all browsers are patched"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "Chrome is the world's most widely used browser with billions of active users. A use-after-free vulnerability in the CSS engine is extremely dangerous because CSS is processed on virtually every webpage, meaning exploitation requires no special user action beyond visiting a malicious page. The confirmed in-the-wild exploitation means attackers have already weaponized this flaw. While the exploit runs inside Chrome's sandbox, it can still steal credentials, hijack sessions, and serve as the first stage of a more destructive attack chain when combined with a sandbox escape."
