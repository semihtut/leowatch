  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "Two new ransomware families have emerged in February 2026, each designed to cause maximum damage in minimum time. BQTLock is a stealth-focused ransomware that hides inside Windows system processes to avoid detection while stealing data and encrypting files. GREENBLOOD is a speed-focused ransomware written in Go that can encrypt entire systems in minutes using military-grade encryption. Both families combine file encryption with data theft and operate leak sites where stolen data is published to pressure victims into paying ransoms.",
    "who_is_affected": "All Windows-based organizations are potential targets. Both ransomware families target enterprise environments across multiple industries. Organizations with weak endpoint protection, unpatched systems, or insufficient backup procedures are at highest risk. GREENBLOOD operates a TOR-based leak site for double extortion, meaning even organizations that can recover from encryption face the threat of having sensitive data published publicly.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: BQTLock gains initial access and injects the Remcos remote access trojan directly into explorer.exe, a core Windows process, making the malware invisible to basic security tools. Step 2: It performs a UAC bypass using the legitimate Windows tool fodhelper.exe to silently escalate to administrator privileges without triggering any user prompt. Step 3: With elevated access, BQTLock establishes autorun persistence in the registry and begins harvesting credentials and capturing screenshots for intelligence gathering. Step 4: GREENBLOOD deploys its Go-based payload that uses ChaCha8 encryption (an optimized variant of ChaCha20) to rapidly encrypt files across the network, appending the .tgbg extension. Step 5: Both families exfiltrate stolen data before encryption, then GREENBLOOD self-deletes to hamper forensic analysis while its TOR leak site threatens to publish exfiltrated data unless ransom is paid.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Ensure EDR solutions are configured to detect process injection into explorer.exe and UAC bypass via fodhelper.exe",
      "Block known BQTLock IOCs including Remcos C2 infrastructure and associated file hashes at the network perimeter",
      "Verify offline backup integrity and test restoration procedures as GREENBLOOD encryption completes before response teams can react",
      "Monitor for GREENBLOOD indicators including the GREENBLOOD_ENCRYPTOR_MUTEX_ mutex pattern and .tgbg file extensions",
      "Implement network segmentation to limit lateral movement and restrict unnecessary SMB/RDP access between systems"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "These ransomware families represent the evolution of modern ransomware toward maximum impact in minimum time. BQTLock's ability to hide inside legitimate Windows processes makes it extremely difficult to detect with traditional security tools. GREENBLOOD's ChaCha8 encryption can process hundreds of gigabytes per hour, meaning an entire organization can be encrypted in minutes before response teams can intervene. The combination of stealth infiltration, rapid encryption, data theft, and public leak-site extortion creates a multi-layered threat that overwhelms traditional incident response workflows."
