    "what_happened": "A critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2026-24858) in Fortinet's FortiCloud Single Sign-On allows attackers with any FortiCloud account to access devices registered to OTHER organizations' FortiCloud accounts. This is a separate vulnerability from the previously patched CVE-2025-59718. Attackers exploited this flaw starting January 20, 2026, using two malicious FortiCloud accounts to compromise devices across multiple organizations. Fortinet was forced to globally disable FortiCloud SSO on January 26 to stop the bleeding.",
    "who_is_affected": "Organizations using FortiCloud SSO authentication on FortiOS, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, or FortiProxy devices. This affects enterprises worldwide that use Fortinet's cloud-managed authentication for their network security infrastructure. FortiManager Cloud, FortiAnalyzer Cloud, and FortiGate Cloud services are NOT affected. Organizations using custom IdP (including FortiAuthenticator) are also not impacted.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Create or compromise a FortiCloud account with at least one registered device. Step 2: Exploit CVE-2026-24858 to authenticate to devices registered under OTHER FortiCloud accounts. Step 3: Download victim organization's firewall configuration files (contains sensitive network topology, rules, credentials). Step 4: Create new local administrator accounts on the compromised devices. Step 5: Create VPN-enabled user accounts for persistent remote access. Step 6: Arctic Wolf observed this entire attack chain completing within seconds, indicating fully automated exploitation.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Immediately disable FortiCloud SSO: System > Settings > Switch 'Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO' to Off",
      "Upgrade to FortiOS 7.4.11 or wait for upcoming patches for other product versions",
      "Audit all local administrator accounts - delete any unrecognized accounts",
      "Review VPN user accounts for unauthorized additions",
      "Check device configurations for unauthorized changes",
      "Rotate all credentials that may have been in exported configurations",
      "Enable multi-factor authentication for all administrative access",
      "Monitor for connections from unknown IP addresses to management interfaces"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "This vulnerability allows cross-tenant attacks through Fortinet's cloud authentication service. Any attacker with a FortiCloud account could potentially access any other organization's Fortinet devices that have FortiCloud SSO enabled. The attacks were automated and completed config exfiltration and admin account creation within seconds. Fortinet firewalls protect critical network perimeters - compromised configurations expose network topology, security rules, and potentially credentials. This is the SECOND critical Fortinet auth bypass in January 2026, raising serious questions about the security of cloud-managed network infrastructure."
