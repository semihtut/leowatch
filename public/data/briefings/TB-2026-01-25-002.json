  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "The ShinyHunters extortion gang has launched a sophisticated voice phishing (vishing) campaign targeting employees at organizations using cloud identity providers. Attackers call victims pretending to be IT support, using custom phishing kits designed for voice-based social engineering. They capture SSO credentials and real-time MFA codes to breach corporate SaaS platforms and steal data for extortion.",
    "who_is_affected": "Any organization using Okta, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), or Google Workspace for single sign-on. The attacks specifically target employees with access to sensitive SaaS applications containing valuable corporate data.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Attackers research target organizations and identify employees with privileged SaaS access. Step 2: They call victims pretending to be IT helpdesk, often spoofing internal phone numbers. Step 3: They create urgency by claiming account security issues requiring immediate verification. Step 4: They trick victims into providing SSO credentials and real-time MFA codes over the phone. Step 5: They immediately use stolen credentials to access cloud platforms and exfiltrate sensitive data for extortion.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Send immediate security awareness alert about vishing attacks to all employees",
      "Implement phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware security keys) for privileged users",
      "Establish and communicate clear policy that IT will never ask for passwords or MFA codes over phone",
      "Enable number-matching or additional context in MFA push notifications",
      "Review SSO logs for unusual login patterns or geographic anomalies",
      "Implement impossible travel detection in identity provider",
      "Consider callback verification for sensitive account changes"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "Cloud SSO is the keys to the kingdom. A single compromised SSO account can provide access to dozens of connected SaaS applications containing sensitive corporate data, customer information, source code, financial records, and HR data. ShinyHunters has a proven track record of large-scale data breaches and successful extortion campaigns."
