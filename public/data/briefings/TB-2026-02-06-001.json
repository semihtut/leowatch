  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "Chinese state-sponsored hackers from the Lotus Blossom APT group compromised the hosting infrastructure behind Notepad++, one of the world's most popular text editors with millions of users. By hijacking the hosting provider's servers, they were able to intercept software update requests and selectively redirect a small number of targeted users to malicious download servers. Instead of receiving legitimate Notepad++ updates, these victims downloaded trojanized installers that deployed sophisticated backdoor malware called Chrysalis. The attack lasted approximately six months, from June through December 2025, before being fully remediated. The vast majority of Notepad++ users were unaffected because the attackers deliberately targeted only about a dozen machines belonging to specific organizations and individuals.",
    "who_is_affected": "Notepad++ users running versions prior to 8.8.9 who used the built-in auto-update feature between June and December 2025 were potentially at risk. The attackers specifically targeted: individuals in Vietnam, El Salvador, and Australia; a government organization in the Philippines; a financial organization in El Salvador; and a Vietnamese IT service provider. Organizations in the telecom, government, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors across Southeast Asia and Central America were the primary focus. Any organization that used Notepad++ during the compromise window should verify their installations against published IOCs.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: The attackers compromised the shared hosting server that hosts notepad-plus-plus.org at the infrastructure level, gaining access to the server's kernel, firmware, and internal service credentials. Step 2: Using this access, they intercepted update requests from Notepad++ users and selectively redirected targeted users' traffic to attacker-controlled servers based on IP address filtering. Step 3: The malicious server delivered a trojanized NSIS installer (update.exe) instead of the legitimate Notepad++ update, exploiting the fact that WinGUp (the updater) performed no cryptographic signature validation on downloaded files. Step 4: The installer deployed a DLL sideloading attack using a renamed legitimate Bitdefender Submission Wizard (BluetoothService.exe) that loaded a malicious log.dll, which decrypted embedded shellcode using custom stream cipher algorithms. Step 5: The shellcode initialized the Chrysalis backdoor, which established encrypted C2 communications with attacker servers (api.skycloudcenter.com, api.wiresguard.com), providing 16 remote control commands including interactive shell access, file exfiltration, process execution, and complete self-removal capabilities.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Immediately update Notepad++ to version 8.9.1 or later by manually downloading from the official website (do NOT rely on the built-in updater for this update)",
      "Check systems for IOC directories: %APPDATA%\\ProShow\\, %APPDATA%\\Adobe\\Scripts\\, and %APPDATA%\\Bluetooth\\ which indicate active compromise",
      "Scan for known malicious file hashes using published SHA-256 indicators, particularly log.dll (3bdc4c0637591533f1d4198a72a33426c01f69bd2e15ceee547866f65e26b7ad) and update.exe (a511be5164dc1122fb5a7daa3eef9467e43d8458425b15a640235796006590c9)",
      "Block known C2 domains and IPs at the firewall: api.skycloudcenter.com, api.wiresguard.com, cdncheck.it.com, safe-dns.it.com, self-dns.it.com, 45.76.155.202, 45.32.144.255, 95.179.213.0, 45.77.31.210",
      "Run the community IOC checking script from github.com/roady001/Check-NotepadPlusPlusIOC on all Windows endpoints",
      "Review network logs for connections to known C2 infrastructure during the June-December 2025 timeframe and investigate any matches as potential active compromises"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "This represents a highly sophisticated supply chain attack against one of the world's most widely used development tools, leveraging a trusted software update mechanism to deliver state-sponsored espionage malware. The attack demonstrates that even infrastructure-level compromises at hosting providers can be weaponized to target specific high-value organizations while flying under the radar of millions of other users. The Chrysalis backdoor's 16-command capability set, combined with the use of Microsoft Warbird obfuscation, custom encryption, and legitimate binary sideloading, shows a significant evolution in Lotus Blossom's tooling that makes detection extremely difficult. The six-month dwell time before discovery underscores the stealth of this operation."
