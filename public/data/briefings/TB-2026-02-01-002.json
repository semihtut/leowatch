  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "A maximum-severity vulnerability was discovered in the Modular DS WordPress plugin, which is installed on over 40,000 websites. The plugin is designed to let site owners and hosting providers remotely manage multiple WordPress sites. Due to a series of critical design flaws in its REST API routing, unauthenticated attackers can bypass all authentication and instantly gain full administrator access to any WordPress site running the vulnerable plugin. Attackers have been actively exploiting this since January 13, creating rogue admin accounts and installing malicious plugins for persistent control.",
    "who_is_affected": "Any WordPress website running the Modular DS plugin versions 2.5.1 or earlier. This includes websites managed by hosting providers, development agencies, and organizations that use the plugin for centralized multi-site management. Over 40,000 active installations are potentially affected.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Attackers scan the internet for WordPress sites with the Modular DS plugin installed. Step 2: They send a crafted HTTP request to /api/modular-connector/login/ with origin=mo parameter to bypass authentication. Step 3: The flawed routing mechanism treats the request as a trusted direct connection and auto-logs them in as administrator. Step 4: Attackers create rogue admin accounts with usernames like 'support2026', 'admin_backup', or 'backup' to maintain persistent access. Step 5: They install malicious plugins or themes containing backdoors, enabling them to fully control the website, inject malware, redirect visitors to phishing sites, or steal user data.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Update Modular DS plugin to version 2.6.0 or later immediately on all WordPress sites",
      "Audit all WordPress admin accounts for unauthorized users (check for 'support2026', 'admin_backup', 'backup' usernames)",
      "Review wp-admin access logs for requests to /api/modular-connector/login/ from suspicious IPs",
      "Block attacker IPs 45.11.89.19 and 185.196.0.11 at WAF or firewall level",
      "Regenerate WordPress authentication salts to invalidate all existing sessions",
      "Regenerate OAuth credentials used by the Modular DS plugin",
      "Scan for malicious plugins, themes, or injected code using a security scanner",
      "Add WAF rules to block requests to /api/modular-connector/ with origin=mo parameter",
      "If compromise is confirmed, perform full site restore from a pre-January 13 backup"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "A CVSS 10.0 score means this is as bad as it gets. Unauthenticated attackers can take complete control of any affected WordPress site with a single HTTP request. The plugin's purpose - remote site management - means it inherently has high privileges. With a public PoC available and active exploitation ongoing, unpatched sites face near-certain compromise. Compromised WordPress sites are then used as platforms for phishing, malware distribution, SEO spam, and attacking visitors."
