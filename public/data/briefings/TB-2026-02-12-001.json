    "what_happened": "Microsoft released its February 2026 security update fixing 58 vulnerabilities, including 6 zero-day flaws that hackers were already actively exploiting before the patch was available. Three of these zero-days were publicly known before Microsoft could fix them. CISA has added all six to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog with a March 3 deadline for federal agencies.",
    "who_is_affected": "Every organization running Windows desktops (Windows 10/11), Windows Server (2012 R2 through 2025), Microsoft Office (365, LTSC 2021/2024, 2016/2019), or Remote Desktop Services. This covers virtually all enterprise Windows environments worldwide.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Attackers send phishing emails with malicious links or Office document attachments to targets. Step 2: When victims click links, CVE-2026-21510 bypasses Windows SmartScreen warnings, or CVE-2026-21513 bypasses MSHTML security filters, allowing malware to run without any user warning. Step 3: Malicious Office documents exploit CVE-2026-21514 to bypass OLE protections and execute code silently without the usual security prompts. Step 4: Once inside, attackers use CVE-2026-21519 (DWM type confusion) to escalate from normal user to SYSTEM administrator privileges. Step 5: Attackers leverage CVE-2026-21533 to escalate privileges on Remote Desktop servers, or use CVE-2026-21525 to crash VPN/remote access services and disrupt operations.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Deploy February 2026 Patch Tuesday updates to all Windows systems immediately, prioritizing internet-facing and critical systems within 24-48 hours",
      "Block or quarantine Office attachments from external email sources and warn users about clicking links from unknown senders",
      "Enforce MFA on all Remote Desktop Services and restrict RDS access to specific trusted IP ranges",
      "Hunt for indicators of prior compromise: check for Office processes spawning unexpected child processes, DWM privilege escalation attempts, and RasMan service crashes",
      "Disable Internet Explorer mode in Edge and legacy MSHTML rendering where not required by business applications"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "Six simultaneously exploited zero-days is an exceptionally high number for a single Patch Tuesday. The combination of security feature bypasses (allowing initial access without warnings) and privilege escalation flaws (enabling full system takeover) creates a devastating attack chain. Threat actors including APT groups are already using these in coordinated campaigns. Every unpatched Windows system is at immediate risk."
