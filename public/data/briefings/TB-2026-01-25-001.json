  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "A critical authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Fortinet firewalls that allows attackers to access the FortiCloud management panel without valid credentials by sending crafted SAML messages. The patch released in December 2025 did not fully fix the issue, and fully patched firewalls are still being compromised in active attacks.",
    "who_is_affected": "Any organization using FortiOS, FortiProxy, FortiWeb, or FortiSwitchManager with FortiCloud SSO enabled for centralized management. This includes enterprises, government agencies, and managed security providers.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Attackers scan the internet for exposed Fortinet management interfaces. Step 2: They send specially crafted SAML authentication messages to bypass signature verification. Step 3: They gain administrative access to FortiCloud without valid credentials. Step 4: They create rogue administrator accounts for persistent access. Step 5: They download complete firewall configurations containing VPN credentials, pre-shared keys, and network topology.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Disable FortiCloud SSO immediately and switch to local authentication",
      "Audit all administrator accounts and remove any unauthorized accounts",
      "Review admin login logs for the past 30 days for suspicious activity",
      "Restrict management interface access to trusted IP addresses only",
      "Compare current config against known-good backup for unauthorized changes",
      "Rotate VPN credentials if configuration theft is suspected",
      "Monitor Fortinet advisories for complete patch release"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "Firewalls are the primary perimeter defense. Compromise provides attackers with VPN credentials, internal network topology, and the ability to modify security rules. This enables ransomware deployment, data exfiltration, and persistent network access. The incomplete patch status means even diligent organizations remain vulnerable."
