  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "A serious security bug was found in Fortinet FortiGate firewalls. Attackers can log in as admin without a password. They use a trick with login messages (called SAML) to bypass security. The bad news: even firewalls that installed the patch are still getting hacked.",
    "who_is_affected": "Any organization using FortiGate firewalls, FortiProxy, FortiWeb, or FortiSwitchManager. You are at risk if FortiCloud SSO login is turned on. This affects FortiOS versions 7.0.x and 7.2.x.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: They send a fake login message to your firewall. Step 2: The firewall thinks they are a real admin. Step 3: They download your firewall settings and passwords. Step 4: They create new admin accounts to come back later. Step 5: They can now control your entire network.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Turn off FortiCloud SSO login right now",
      "Check your logs for strange logins (especially from unknown IPs)",
      "If you see suspicious logins, reset all admin passwords immediately",
      "Block management access from the internet",
      "Wait for the new patch and install it as soon as it's released",
      "Review all admin accounts - delete any you don't recognize"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "This is a firewall - it protects your entire network. If attackers control your firewall, they can see all your traffic, change security rules, and enter your network whenever they want. This is like giving a burglar the keys to your house and the code to your alarm."
