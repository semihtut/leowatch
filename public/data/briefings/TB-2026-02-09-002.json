  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "A critical OS command injection vulnerability was discovered in the React Native CLI's Metro Development Server, a tool used by millions of mobile app developers worldwide. The flaw allows attackers on the local network to execute arbitrary system commands on developer machines by sending a simple HTTP POST request to the /open-url endpoint. The vulnerability exists because Metro binds to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) by default despite logging 'localhost', and the URL parameter is passed unsanitized to the system's open command. Active exploitation has been ongoing since December 21, 2025, with attackers deploying UPX-packed Rust-based malware through multiple waves of attacks. CISA added this to the KEV catalog on February 5, 2026. Approximately 3,500 exposed Metro servers have been found via internet scanning.",
    "who_is_affected": "All organizations and developers using @react-native-community/cli versions 4.8.0 through 20.0.0-alpha.2 are at risk when running Metro Dev Server (npm start or npx react-native start). The package has 2-2.5 million weekly downloads. Developer workstations, CI/CD build servers, and any environment running Metro are vulnerable if the server is network-accessible. Windows developers face the highest risk with full arbitrary command execution, while macOS and Linux developers face arbitrary executable execution with limited parameter control. Projects using Expo's dev server are NOT affected. ZoomEye scanning identified approximately 3,500 exposed React Native Metro servers on the internet.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: The attacker scans the network for Metro Dev Servers listening on port 8081, which are exposed due to Metro binding to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) by default instead of localhost only. Step 2: The attacker sends an HTTP POST request to the /open-url endpoint with a malicious URL parameter containing injected shell commands; no authentication is required. Step 3: On Windows targets, the URL parameter is passed unsanitized to the open npm package, which constructs cmd /c start '' /b <payload>, allowing shell metacharacters to inject arbitrary commands including base64-encoded PowerShell payloads. Step 4: The PowerShell loader adds Microsoft Defender exclusion paths for the current working directory and %TEMP% via Add-MpPreference to evade detection. Step 5: The loader establishes a raw TCP socket to C2 infrastructure (8.218.43.248:60124), sends a GET /windows request to retrieve the next-stage payload, writes it as a UPX-packed Rust binary to %TEMP%, and executes it with encoded arguments, completing the compromise of the developer workstation.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Immediately update @react-native-community/cli-server-api to version 18.0.1, 19.1.2, or 20.0.0 or later across all development environments and CI/CD pipelines",
      "As an interim mitigation, always start Metro with explicit localhost binding: npx react-native start --host 127.0.0.1",
      "Block external access to port 8081 on all developer machines and CI/CD runners via firewall rules",
      "Scan developer workstations for IOCs: connections to 8.218.43.248:60124 or 47.86.33.195:60130, PowerShell Add-MpPreference commands, UPX-packed executables in %TEMP%",
      "Run npm audit across all React Native projects to identify vulnerable dependencies",
      "Implement network segmentation to isolate development environments from production networks and restrict outbound connections from dev machines"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "This vulnerability represents a rare and dangerous attack vector targeting the software development pipeline itself. Unlike most vulnerabilities that affect production systems, Metro4Shell compromises developer workstations and CI/CD infrastructure, giving attackers access to source code, signing keys, deployment credentials, and the ability to inject malicious code into production builds. The sustained, multi-wave exploitation campaign (3 waves over 4 weeks with consistent payloads) indicates mature, professional threat actors rather than opportunistic scanning. The combination of 2.5 million weekly downloads, default exposure to the network, and zero authentication makes this an attractive target for supply chain attacks. Cross-platform Rust malware payloads for both Windows and Linux demonstrate the attackers' capability to compromise diverse development environments."
