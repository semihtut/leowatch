  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "A vulnerability was found in AWS Lambda Function URLs that use IAM authentication. Under certain conditions, attackers can bypass authentication by manipulating request headers. This allows unauthorized access to Lambda functions that should be protected.",
    "who_is_affected": "AWS customers using Lambda Function URLs with IAM authentication type. Functions that rely solely on Function URL authentication without additional authorization checks are vulnerable.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Attacker identifies Lambda Function URLs through reconnaissance. Step 2: They craft requests with manipulated authentication headers. Step 3: The Lambda service incorrectly validates the request. Step 4: Unauthorized access to the Lambda function is granted. Step 5: Attackers can invoke functions, access data, and potentially pivot to other resources.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Review all Lambda Function URLs in your account",
      "Add application-level authorization checks in your Lambda code",
      "Consider using API Gateway with Lambda authorizers instead",
      "Enable CloudWatch Logs and monitor for unusual invocations",
      "Use resource-based policies to restrict Function URL access"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "Lambda functions often have access to databases, secrets, and other AWS services. An authentication bypass means attackers can access your business logic and data without credentials. Since Function URLs are publicly accessible endpoints, they're easy targets for automated attacks."
