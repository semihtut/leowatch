  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "Zimbra Collaboration Suite has a PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in the /h/rest endpoint that allows attackers to manipulate internal request dispatching and include arbitrary files from the WebRoot directory, potentially leading to remote code execution on the mail server.",
    "who_is_affected": "Organizations using Zimbra for email and collaboration, including on-premises deployments and cloud-hosted instances. Zimbra is widely used by enterprises, universities, and government organizations.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Craft malicious HTTP requests to the /h/rest endpoint. Step 2: Manipulate internal request dispatching through parameter injection. Step 3: Include arbitrary PHP files from the WebRoot directory. Step 4: Achieve remote code execution on the mail server. Step 5: Access all emails, contact lists, calendars, and pivot to internal network.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Patch Zimbra to the latest version immediately",
      "Implement WAF rules to block malicious /h/rest requests",
      "Review mail server access logs for suspicious request patterns",
      "Audit user accounts for unauthorized access or new accounts",
      "Check for webshells or unauthorized files in WebRoot"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "Email servers contain highly sensitive corporate communications, contact information, and calendar data. They are often trusted by internal systems for authentication. Compromise enables email theft, business email compromise (BEC) attacks from legitimate accounts, and lateral movement into the corporate network."
