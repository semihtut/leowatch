  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "A critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) was discovered in React Server Components, dubbed React2Shell. The flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on servers through a single malicious HTTP request without any authentication. Default configurations created with create-next-app are vulnerable with no code changes required.",
    "who_is_affected": "Any organization running React 19.x or Next.js 15.x/16.x with App Router is vulnerable. This includes millions of web applications running on cloud platforms. The vulnerability particularly impacts internet-facing Next.js frontends and React Server Component workloads running in Kubernetes clusters and managed PaaS platforms.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Attacker identifies a vulnerable React Server Components application. Step 2: Crafts a malicious HTTP request exploiting unsafe deserialization in the Flight protocol. Step 3: Injects arbitrary objects that get deserialized in privileged server contexts. Step 4: Executes arbitrary code on the server. Step 5: Harvests cloud credentials (AWS, Azure, GCP tokens, Kubernetes service accounts). Step 6: Deploys cryptominers, backdoors, or moves laterally to other cloud resources.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Immediately upgrade React to patched versions: 19.0.1, 19.1.2, or 19.2.1",
      "Upgrade Next.js to latest patched version",
      "Enable AWS WAF with AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet (v1.24+) for automatic protection",
      "Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud agentless scanning to detect vulnerable containers",
      "Review logs for suspicious deserialization patterns",
      "Rotate cloud credentials if running vulnerable versions"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "React powers millions of web applications worldwide. State-sponsored threat groups from China are actively exploiting this vulnerability within hours of disclosure. The attack requires no authentication and works against default configurations. CISA has added it to the mandatory patch list. Compromised servers can lead to cloud account takeover, data theft, and cryptomining."
