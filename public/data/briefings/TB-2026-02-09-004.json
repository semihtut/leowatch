  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "Russia's APT28 (Fancy Bear / GRU Unit 26165) weaponized a Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability within approximately 24 hours of its public disclosure and launched a concentrated espionage campaign called Operation Neusploit against NATO-aligned nations. Between January 28-30, 2026, the group sent at least 29 spear-phishing emails containing malicious RTF documents to defense ministries, transportation operators, and diplomatic entities across Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania, Poland, Slovenia, Turkey, Greece, and UAE. The malicious documents exploit CVE-2026-21509, a security feature bypass that allows code execution without macros simply by opening the file. The campaign deploys two previously unknown malware families: MiniDoor (an email-stealing backdoor) and PixyNetLoader (a sophisticated multi-stage dropper using steganography and COM hijacking).",
    "who_is_affected": "All organizations running unpatched Microsoft Office 2016, 2019, LTSC 2021, LTSC 2024, or Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise are vulnerable. The Operation Neusploit campaign specifically targeted: defense ministries (~40% of targets), transportation and logistics operators (~35%), diplomatic entities (~25%), and central executive authorities. Target countries include Ukraine (60+ email addresses), Slovakia, Romania, Poland, Slovenia, Turkey, Greece, and UAE. European maritime, aviation, and transport agencies were also targeted per Trellix analysis. However, any organization receiving email-borne RTF documents is at risk since the vulnerability requires only opening the file.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: APT28 sends spear-phishing emails with geopolitically-charged lures (transnational weapons smuggling, military training programs, meteorological bulletins) containing malicious RTF attachments crafted in English and localized languages including Romanian, Slovak, and Ukrainian. Step 2: When the victim opens the RTF document, Microsoft Office instantiates the Shell.Explorer.1 COM object (CLSID {EAB22AC3-30C1-11CF-A7EB-0000C05BAE0B}) which loads the legacy Internet Explorer engine, bypassing OLE mitigations without requiring macros or additional user interaction. Step 3: The embedded browser calls Navigate() to fetch a remote .lNk file from attacker infrastructure (freefoodaid[.]com), with the server performing geographic and User-Agent filtering to only deliver payloads to targets in the correct regions. Step 4: For the MiniDoor variant, a dropper DLL is downloaded that deploys a C++ backdoor with a malicious Outlook VBA project, which steals emails from Inbox/Drafts/Junk folders and forwards them to attacker-controlled addresses (ahmeclaw2002@outlook.com, ahmeclaw@proton.me), while lowering Outlook macro security via registry modifications. Step 5: For the PixyNetLoader variant, a multi-stage dropper uses COM object hijacking for explorer.exe persistence, drops a steganographic shellcode carrier (SplashScreen.png) and shellcode loader (EhStoreShell.dll), and ultimately loads a Covenant Grunt .NET C2 implant or BEARDSHELL backdoor that communicates via the filen.io cloud storage API for covert C2.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Verify Microsoft Office is patched: Office 2016 requires KB5002713 (version 16.0.5539.1001+), Office 2019 requires version 16.0.10417.20095+; Office 2021+ and M365 Apps update automatically but require an application restart",

    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "APT28's ability to weaponize a zero-day vulnerability within 24 hours of disclosure demonstrates exceptional offensive capability and likely prior knowledge of the vulnerability. The Operation Neusploit campaign targets defense and transportation infrastructure across NATO-aligned nations during a period of heightened geopolitical tension, consistent with Russian strategic intelligence collection priorities. The MiniDoor email stealer provides APT28 with access to sensitive diplomatic and military communications, while PixyNetLoader's use of steganography, COM hijacking, and legitimate cloud services (filen.io) for C2 makes detection extremely difficult. Turkey is among the target countries, making this directly relevant to organizations in the region."
