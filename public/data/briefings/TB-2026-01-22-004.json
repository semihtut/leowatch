  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "A critical vulnerability was discovered in how AWS S3 bucket policies handle cross-account access. Attackers can exploit the 'confused deputy' problem to access S3 buckets they shouldn't have access to. This happens when bucket policies don't properly validate the source of requests.",
    "who_is_affected": "Any AWS customer using S3 bucket policies with cross-account access, especially those using third-party services that access their S3 buckets. Organizations with broadly permissive bucket policies are most at risk.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Attacker identifies S3 buckets with permissive cross-account policies. Step 2: They use a compromised or malicious AWS account to assume a trusted role. Step 3: The attacker's requests appear to come from a trusted source. Step 4: They gain unauthorized read/write access to sensitive data. Step 5: Data exfiltration or manipulation occurs undetected.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Review all S3 bucket policies for overly permissive cross-account access",
      "Add aws:SourceAccount and aws:SourceArn conditions to all bucket policies",
      "Enable S3 Access Logging and CloudTrail data events",
      "Use AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify public or cross-account access",
      "Implement SCPs to restrict S3 access patterns organization-wide"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "S3 buckets often contain the most sensitive data in an organization - customer data, backups, application secrets, and intellectual property. A confused deputy attack bypasses normal authentication, making it nearly invisible to detection. Your data could be stolen without any alerts firing."
