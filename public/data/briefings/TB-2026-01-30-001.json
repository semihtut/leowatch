  "simple_summary": {
    "what_happened": "Check Point Research discovered a large-scale phishing campaign abusing Google Cloud Application Integration's Send Email feature to deliver approximately 10,000 phishing emails to roughly 3,200 businesses over a two-week period. The emails originate from the legitimate Google address noreply-application-integration@google.com, allowing them to pass SPF, DKIM, and DMARC email authentication checks. Victims are redirected through multiple stages -- first to Google Cloud Storage, then to a googleusercontent.com domain, and finally to a fake Microsoft login page that initiates an OAuth consent phishing flow against Azure AD. xorlab and RavenMail independently documented related campaigns. Google confirmed the abuse was blocked and stated it did not involve an infrastructure compromise.",
    "who_is_affected": "Organizations using Microsoft 365 and Azure AD, particularly in the United States (48.6% of targets). The most impacted industries are manufacturing (19.6%), technology and SaaS (18.9%), and finance (14.8%). Any business whose employees might interact with emails from legitimate Google addresses is at risk, as the phishing emails bypass standard email security gateways due to their trusted origin.",
    "what_attackers_do": "Step 1: Abuse Google Cloud Application Integration's Send Email task to dispatch phishing emails from the legitimate address noreply-application-integration@google.com, bypassing email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC). Step 2: Redirect victims through a multi-stage chain: Google Cloud Storage link to a googleusercontent.com intermediary, then to a fake Microsoft login page hosted on AWS S3 or similar infrastructure. Step 3: Present the victim with a fraudulent OAuth consent screen requesting the scope https://management.core.windows.net//.default, which grants broad access to Azure management APIs. Step 4: Capture valid OAuth tokens when the victim approves the consent prompt, completely bypassing multi-factor authentication. Step 5: Use the stolen OAuth tokens for persistent access to the victim's Microsoft 365 environment, including email, files, and Azure resources.",
    "what_you_should_do": [
      "Alert employees about phishing emails from noreply-application-integration@google.com that contain unexpected links or OAuth consent requests",
      "Review Azure AD sign-in logs and audit logs for suspicious OAuth consent grants, especially those requesting management.core.windows.net scopes",
      "Revoke any unauthorized OAuth application consents in Azure AD (Enterprise Applications > User Consent)",
      "Configure Azure AD to require admin approval for OAuth consent requests (User Settings > Enterprise Applications > Users can consent to apps > No)",
      "Block or flag emails containing links to googleusercontent.com and storage.googleapis.com domains in phishing contexts",
      "Deploy phishing-resistant authentication methods such as FIDO2 security keys or certificate-based authentication",
      "Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to detect anomalous OAuth application activity",
      "Review Conditional Access policies to restrict token issuance to compliant devices and trusted locations"
    ],
    "why_this_is_serious": "This campaign is particularly dangerous because the phishing emails originate from a legitimate Google infrastructure address, causing them to pass all standard email authentication checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and evade most email security gateways. The multi-stage redirection through Google-owned domains further increases trust. Most critically, the OAuth consent phishing approach captures valid access tokens rather than passwords, which means multi-factor authentication provides no protection. Stolen OAuth tokens can grant persistent, long-term access to Microsoft 365 environments without triggering typical credential-theft detection mechanisms. The scale of approximately 10,000 emails to 3,200 businesses in just two weeks indicates an organized and well-resourced operation."
