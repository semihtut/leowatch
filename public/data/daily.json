ShinyHunters is actively targeting cloud identity providers (Okta, Microsoft, Google) through sophisticated vishing attacks. Multiple CISA KEV additions this week affect enterprise cloud infrastructure including VMware vCenter, Versa SD-WAN, and Zimbra. Organizations must prioritize identity security hardening and emergency patching of network infrastructure."

Step 2: They send specially crafted SAML authentication messages to bypass signature verification. Step 3: They gain administrative access to FortiCloud without valid credentials.
